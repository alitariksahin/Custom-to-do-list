# Custom-to-do-list

This project allows users to have their very own to-do-list.<br>
Here is the link: to-do-list-ats.onrender.com/ (initial access may take up to 30 seconds due to the free service I deployed my application)<br>

<h2>Technologies used</h2>
On the back side I used Node.js/Express and mongoDB to keep track of the data.<br>
On the front side I utilized EJS, html and css.<br>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
As soon as you open the link you are faced with the main page whose title is the date you open it. This page is common to every user. <br>
You can use adding and removing functionalities here and they will be recorded on database.<br>
<em>However if you want to have a spesific(custom) to-do-list, all you have to do is writing an extension to the main url. (e.g. to-do-list-ats.onrender.com/work)<br>
Doing so you will have your very own to-do-list whose url is known only by you. What you do on this site will remain on this site and won't be visible to other users
unless you share the spesific url you choose.</em><br>
